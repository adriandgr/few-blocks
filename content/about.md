Some updates coming to you real soon.

***

Hello world. I’m a web-developer-in-training / artist.

### What do I do?
I like to learn different web technologies. I’m on Github.

### What programming languages do I use?
When making static sites (like this one!) I like to use Jekyll. I have a strong interest in data-driven dynamic websites. I recently started learning Javascript and Express. I’ve encountered Python, Java, and Objective C along my code adventures.
