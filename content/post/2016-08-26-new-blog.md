**TL;DR** I'm making another attempt at writing a blog. I'm keeping things simple using Micah Cowell's [Basic Jekyll theme](https://github.com/getmicah/getmicah.github.io)

*Updated 16.09.28:* Haven't been able to wrap my head around a proper introductory post. I'm going to skip this for now and come back to it when I have a better idea where this is headed.

*Updated 17.03.13:* This is the six month mark of my micro-blog site. For the time being I'm using it as an online notebook / study tool to help me map out my web dev journey. As I gain more experience, the entries should become more interesting for people other than myself.

*Updated 17.07.10:* No longer using Jekyll... trying out Hugo for the first time. Having lots of experience with static site generators, the transitions couldn't have gone any smoother. Build times are marginally faster (given the size of the site) but still a noticeable improvement. Hugo's hot reload feature is what really puts in on top of Jekyll's dev server. Still keeping things simple by using nodejh's [Cactus Plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus) theme.
